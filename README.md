# dapertium

Automatic documentation generation for Apertium language data files. Final project for LING 073 at Swarthmore College.

## Random thoughts related to development (todo: remove)

goal for proof of concept:
  - autogen html documentation for lexc
  - make sure system can be extended to document other file types

interesting ideas:
  - given a correctly analyzing corpus, autogenerate examples

steps:
  - identify files for which to generate documentation
  - parse those files (possibly use apertium to parse, since apertium outputs nice code)
  -
